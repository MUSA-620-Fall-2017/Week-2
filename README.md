# Week-2
Working with Census data ([notes](https://github.com/MUSA-620-Fall-2017/Week-2/blob/master/week-2-census-data.pptx))

**Useful links**

Census Data:
- [MPC: National Historical Geographic Information System](http://www.nhgis.org/) - for summary-level ACS data and boundary files
- [MPC: Integrated Public Use Microdata Series](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) - for ACS microdata

GIS Boundaries:
- [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) - clean, simple shapefiles for commonly-used boundaries
- [Global Administrative Areas](http://www.gadm.org/) - detailed boundary files for a range of administrative levels

Map Simplification:
- [Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org/) - great tool for reducing the size of large GIS files. Before using, it is usually best to make sure your file uses the standard latitude, longitude coordinate system ("WGS 84"), and is in GEOJSON format (otherwise your attribute table may be lost).
